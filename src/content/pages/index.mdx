<span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">**Hello.**</span>

You've just come across this small corner of the Internet owned by _James_.

This individual who inhabits this space has been lurking around since monitors are still squares. In the past, he could not afford dial-up while his peers play an online game. With envy, he explored its files and started writing game scripts. This experience ignited his love for programming.	After getting connected to _The Wired_, he found himself exploring topics like command-line, linux, web, hacking, pop-culture, anime, gaming, freedom and the list goes on and on.. that considering his wide range of interests, one might speculate that he has a mild case of ADHD.

Here is a list of facts about him:

He has a lot of ~dead~ side-projects that you can find on [github](https://github.com/kapitanluffy). Currently, he is actively trying to maintain these projects on his spare time:

- [Compass Navigator](https://github.com/kapitanluffy/sublime-compass)

He did have a [blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20170801000000*/http://www.piratelufi.com/) years ago. Now, he just posts random things on the [twtr](https://x.com/kapitanluffy).

He used to idle on IRC. Now, he usually hangs out in his server's voice chat on [discord](https://discord.com/users/134311051356405760).

He has a [lnkdn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmscsn/) so he can get hired for work.

He has presence in various platforms: [mstdn](https://mastodon.social/@kapitanluffy), [bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/kapitanluffy.bsky.social)

You can reach out to him through [email](mailto:kapitanluffy@gmail.com).
